# LLM Cost Management

LLM cost has become one of the most discussed challenges for teams shipping AI products in 2026. However, the tooling and practices for managing those costs remain fragmented across observability platforms, routing libraries, caching layers, quantization research, provider documentation, and pricing calculators. There is no single, consolidated reference, & this list is intended to serve as that reference.

Three independent layers. Each cuts a different slice of cost. You want all three.

### Provider prompt caching

Cuts the cost of the cached portion of input tokens. Use for stable system prompts, RAG context, tool definitions.

## Patterns 🔻

The techniques themselves, not the tools that implement them. Learn the pattern, then pick a tool above.

### Cascade routing

Send each request to the cheapest model first. Run a cheap quality check on the response. Escalate to a more expensive model only if the check fails. Documented in the FrugalGPT paper and operationalised by the RouteLLM framework, both linked in the research and routing sections above. The economic argument is straightforward: most production traffic is easy and a small model is enough.

### Distillation as cost optimization

Train a small model to mimic a large model on your specific traffic. Common practice: log 50,000 to 100,000 production calls from GPT-4 or Claude Opus, fine tune a 7B parameter open model on those traces, swap the small model in for the easy 80 percent of traffic. Cost reductions of 20 to 50x are realistic when the task distribution is narrow. Use TRL or DistillKit (linked above) to build the pipeline.

### Batch and cache stacking

OpenAI and Anthropic both apply batch and cache discounts independently. A request that hits a cached prefix and is submitted via the Batch API gets the cache discount on input tokens plus the 50 percent batch discount on the rest. For workloads that tolerate 24 hour latency, this stack reaches 75 percent off list price.

### Eval driven tier selection

Define an evaluation set that reflects your real traffic. Run it across every model tier you would consider (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, Gemini Flash, Gemini Pro). Pick the cheapest tier that hits your quality bar. Re run quarterly. Most teams over provision because they never tested the cheaper tier on their actual data.

### Prompt deduplication via hashing

Many production workloads send the same exact prompt repeatedly. A keyed hash before the LLM call catches identical requests and serves from a cheap KV store with sub millisecond latency. Far cheaper than semantic caching when the input distribution is naturally repetitive (search autocomplete, classification pipelines, structured extraction).

### Prompt compression

Apply LLMLingua or a similar token level compressor to long prompts before sending. Up to 20x compression in published benchmarks while keeping instruction following intact. Stacks with provider prompt caching: cache the compressed prefix.

### Speculative decoding

For self hosted serving, generate K tokens from a small draft model and verify them in parallel with the target model. 2 to 3x throughput on output tokens with no quality loss when the draft and target are well matched. Native in vLLM and SGLang. See the Leviathan et al. paper linked in the foundational papers section.
