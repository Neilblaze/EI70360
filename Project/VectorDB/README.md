# VectorDB

Supports inserting vectors, searching for similar vectors, and retrieving vectors. It uses cosine similarity as a measure of similarity between vectors.

## Setup and Installation
To set up and run the example, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository via `git clone`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd VectorDB`
3. Create a virtual environment: for Python 3.8 and above: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
- For Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- For macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run `main.py` to see a demonstration of the vector database in action: `python main.py`

To exit the virtual environment, type `deactivate` in the terminal.

> [!NOTE]
> The virtual environment and requirements installation steps are optional but recommended to ensure compatibility and avoid conflicts with other Python packages you may have installed.
