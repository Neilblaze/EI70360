# Description:
Experience the core of Stable Diffusion XL in the swiftest and most straightforward way! Crafted with just 100 lines of code and three enchanted buttons, this application brings models to life with a mystical auto-download feature. By following a five-step spell, witness the marvel of creation on a range of magical devices such as GPU, CPU, and MPS.

# Speed:
- GPU transforms the ethereal into tangible form in the blink of an eye - a mere second.
- MPS, the in-between, requires a handful of seconds to harness its power.
- CPU, the wise elder, takes tens of seconds to conjure up the visual revelation.

# Installation:
Cast the spell:
```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --upgrade
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install diffusers --upgrade
```
Reflect on its progress (for a significant amount of time).

# Commencement:
Recite the charm:
```
python3 app.py
```
Grant it time (the initial ceremony may take longer than expected, indeed, once again).
