    "# Computer Vision III: Detection, Segmentation and Tracking (CV3DST) GNN Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will first develop an extension of the ReID-based tracker we created in the previous exercise that will make it more robust to occlusions by allowing it to recover from missed detections. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will then implement a Message Passing Network from scratch, and we will use to build a model that will learn to combine position information and reid features to directly predict associations between past tracks and detections. We will use this model to create robust tracker. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks are the following:\n",
    "- Adapt the track management scheme of our ReIDTracker allow it to recover from missed detections.\n",
    "- Implement a Message Passing Network from scratch to operate on bipartite graphs\n",
    "- Implement the pairwise feature  computation to obtain features for our Message Passing Network\n",
    "- Train the Message Passing Network and improve your tracker's IDF1 score\n",

We ran the object detector we provided in Exercise 0 and applied to all frames. We also computed reid embeddings for all boxes in every frame of the dataset so that they don't need to be computed every time you run your tracker. This yields over 10x speed improvements. You will not have to work directly with the resulting files, as we have internally adapted the boilerplate code to work with them."

    "The tracker above has an obvious limitation: whenever a track cannot be matched with the detections of a given frame the track will be killed. This means that if our detector misses an object in a single frame (due to e.g. occlusion), we will not be able to recover that track, and we will start a new one. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this issue, we would like to allow our tracker to maintain tracks that are not matched during data association. We will refer to these tracks as **inactive**. During data association, we will try to match the detected boxes for the current frame to both tracks that are active (i.e. tracks that we were able to match in the previous frame) as well as those that are inactive. Therefore, if a detector misses an object in a frame and the object reappears after a few frames, we will still be able to match it to its corresponding track, instead of creating a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to adapt our tracker to have this behavior, we will use the `inactive` attribute from the `track` class (see `tracker/tracker.py`. This attribute will be assigned an integer indicating for how many frames a track has remained unmatched. Whenever we are able to match the track `t`, we will set `t.inactive=0` and, naturally, when tracks are initialized, the class constructor sets `inactive=0`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to maintain the `inactive` attribute of all tracks being kept by tracker so that its value represents the number of frames for which the track has been unmatched. Additionally, we introduce a `patience` parameter. Whenever a track has been inactive for more than `inactive` frames. it will need to be killed."

    "Our ``LongTermReIDHungarianTracker`` is still limited when compared to current modern trackers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, it relies solely on appearance to predict similarity scores between objectes. This can be problematic whenever appearance alone may not discriminative, and it'd be best to also take into account object position and size attributes. Secondly, our tracker can only account for pairwise similarities among objects. Ideally, we would like it to also consider higher-order information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations. We will now build a tracker that will combine both apperance and position information with a Message Passing Neural Network, inspired by the approach presented in [Learning a Neural Solver for Multiple Object Tracking, CVPR 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07515)\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall idea will be to build, for every tracking step, a bipartite graph containing two sets of nodes: past tracks, and detections in the current frame. We will initialize node features with ReID embeddings, and edge features with relative position features and ReID distance. We will use an MPN to refine these edge embeddings. The learning task will be to classify the edge embeddings in this graph, which is equivalent to predicting the entries of our data association similarity matrix.\n"
